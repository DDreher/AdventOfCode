## 🧩 Prerequisites

Python 3.10 (at least that's what I used when I wrote the code :P)    
No third party libs - so far!

## 🏃 Running the Code

The input data files have to be located right besides the python scripts so they're found automatically.

Retrieve your input data from https://adventofcode.com/ and save it as `dayXX.txt` in the folder of the relevant year, e.g. 2023. Replace `XX` with the number of the corresponding day, e.g. `day01`.

After downloading the data your folder may look like this

```
$ ~\AdventOfCode\2023> ls
day01.py  day01.txt
```

Then run the python script for a given day, e.g.

```
$ ~\AdventOfCode\2023> python day01.py
```

## 💭 Why don't you also provide the input data?

The creator of Advent of Code does not want input data to be shared in fear of people trying to clone or steal his website, so I'll comply. Sorry for the inconvenience.

> I don't mind having a few of the inputs posted, please don't go on a quest to collect many or all of the inputs for every puzzle. Doing so makes it that much easier for someone to clone and steal the whole site. I put tons of time and money into Advent of Code, and the many inputs are one way I prevent people from copying the content.
